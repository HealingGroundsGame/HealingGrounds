# Healing Grounds: A Game of Restoration

Welcome to *Healing Grounds*, an open-source game where the objective isn't to defeat monsters, but to heal creatures who are struggling with wounds to their body, mind, or spirit. As a healer, you wander a vast world, meeting creatures in need and helping them find peace, resilience, and connection.

This game is currently in the early stages of development, and we are excited to collaborate with passionate contributors to bring this vision to life!


## Vision and Motivation

Most games rely on a dynamic of confrontation, where creatures often exist simply to be defeated. *Healing Grounds* flips this idea, focusing instead on nurturing and healing. Imagine a world where every encounter can be a step toward restoration, where creatures have their own struggles and the player’s role is to empathize, understand, and support them in healing. 

Each creature you meet has a unique blend of physical, psychological, and social traumas. Your goal is to help them overcome these wounds through actions of care, connection, and compassion. We hope to make this game a powerful reminder of the impact we can have by engaging with others thoughtfully and empathetically.

## Gameplay and Mechanics

In *Healing Grounds*, players will:

- **Heal the Body**: Address physical trauma by using potions, bandages, or herbal treatments.
- **Heal the Mind**: Support creatures with emotional challenges, from mild anxiety to deep psychological wounds. Healing can involve simple affirmations, comforting words, or lending a listening ear.
- **Heal the Spirit**: Strengthen social connections by encouraging self-acceptance and fostering positive relationships. This could mean helping a creature find a friend, reconnect with their community, or simply providing companionship.

### Examples of Healing Actions:
- **Physical Healing**: Using potions, salves, or applying herbs for wounds and injuries.
- **Emotional Healing**: Sitting with a creature, listening to their story, or giving heartfelt compliments that resonate with their strengths.
- **Social Healing**: Introducing creatures to one another, facilitating friendships, or helping them find purpose.

Some creatures may initially resist healing and may even react aggressively. These “boss” characters represent more challenging encounters, requiring greater effort, patience, and deeper understanding. Progress in *Healing Grounds* is marked by each successful healing interaction, building a world that becomes more vibrant and whole with each creature’s transformation.

## Feature Wishlist

We're just beginning, so the possibilities are wide open! Here’s what we hope to implement and would love your help building:

- **Creature Design**: Develop a variety of creatures with unique personalities, traumas, and healing needs.
- **Personalities engine**: Generate various personalities mixing stress traits like Hider, Dreamer, Fighter or soothing Creator trait.
- **Healing Techniques**: Expand the ways players can interact with creatures (e.g., playing music, storytelling, introducing games).
- **Emotional Reactions**: Implement creature responses based on how they feel (e.g., gratefulness, calmness, trust).
- **World-Building**: Design biomes, landscapes, and environments that reflect different moods and themes.
- **Dialogue and Observation Systems**: Create ways for players to understand creature needs through dialogue, body language, or other indicators.
- **Aggressive Creatures and “Boss” Levels**: Design more challenging creatures that may react negatively to healing attempts.
- **Player Abilities**: Build a skill tree that lets players level up healing powers (e.g., empathy, connection, endurance).
- **Visuals and Concept Art**: Design character and environment concept art, healing animations, and UI elements. This includes sketches, digital paintings, and animations to bring creatures and landscapes to life.
